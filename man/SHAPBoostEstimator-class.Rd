\title{SHAPBoostEstimator Class}
\description{
This class implements the SHAPBoost algorithm for feature selection.
It is designed to be extended by specific implementations such as SHAPBoostRegressor and
SHAPBoostSurvival. Any new method should implement the abstract methods defined in this class.
